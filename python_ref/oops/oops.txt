-->Two key features: Encapsulation and inheritance

--> Variable holds data
--> Object holds data and functions(code)

--> Every object is called as real entity which has properties and values

Encapsulation: Wrapping up of both properties and methods in a single logical unti is known as encapsulation.

Class:
->Collection of properties and methods into single logical unit
->The instance of the class is known as object
->By default all properties and methods are public
->'.' operator is used to access both properties and methods
->Private properties and methods starts with "__" , cannot be accessed through an object
->Private properties and methods can be accessed through its public method
->Self is a special argument,it holds current object address
